A common misconception in discussions about typing speed is that
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
any speed above, say, maybe 80 <abbr>wpm</abbr>, isn’t going to hinder anyone when trying to
put anything into the computer
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This particular version comes from <a href="https://bladh.ninja/qwerty.html">an article that&rsquo;s really about something
else</a>, but I&rsquo;ve heard it in almost every discussion. Let&rsquo;s examine it.
</p>

<p>
To be clear, at a steady state in a mature project, I get something like 125
lines of code into production per week. If a line of code corresponds to
something like 10 words, and we divide that by my 35-hour work week<label class="footref" for="fn.1">1</label><input id="fn.1" class="footref-toggle" type="checkbox" /><span class="sidenote"><sup>1</sup> Bless
Sweden and their generous culture around parental leave.</span>, it would seem like I
can type only one word per minute and still get my job done.
</p>

<p>
But the problem isn&rsquo;t throughput. If throughput was the concern, most
professionals could get by with far less than 80 words per minute. Even writers
who work in their natural language struggle with producing more than a few pages
per day; counting charitably, that&rsquo;s less than 5 words per minute.
</p>

<p>
Throughput is not the issue. Latency is.
</p>

<p>
What can we do when we are able to type faster?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Someone writing prose can try multiple ways of shaping their sentences and see
how the sentences interact with each other.
</p>

<p>
When I write articles for this site, I&rsquo;m sure I produce well over 5× the
content that ends up in the final article, re-writing and re-structuring and
deleting things continuously. This happens very quickly, and I don&rsquo;t do it
when I write on a touchscreen or with pen-and-paper, because I write too
slowly on those media. Fast typing unlocks this technique.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Someone writing code can think of how to structure the code, then put it down
into code and very quickly move on to think about the next thing. It&rsquo;s
difficult to type and think at the same time, so any time spent writing is a
pause in thoughts, which can derail the flow.
</p>

<p>
When I write code on a touchscreen or a small keyboard, I find it harder to
keep track of where I&rsquo;m going next, because it takes so damn long to get a
line of code out of my head and onto the screen.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
You can argue that someone writing at 80 words per minute can get a line of
code down in 8 seconds, and learning to write at 120 words per minute will
improve this by a mere three seconds, so what&rsquo;s the big deal?
</p>

<p>
I don&rsquo;t have any science to point to, but imagine being forced to sit and do
nothing (not even think!) for three seconds after every five seconds of typing.
That would drive me up the wall!
