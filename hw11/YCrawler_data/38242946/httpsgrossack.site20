  <p>So I was on math stackexchange the other day, and I saw <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4767549/the-book-youll-need-when-someone-came-up-with-a-random-car-plate-number/4790221#4790221">a cute post</a> 
looking for a book which lists, for many many integers, facts that Ramanujan 
could have told Hardy if he’d taken a cab other than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1729_(number)">1729</a>. A few days ago 
OP answered their own question, saying that the book in question was 
<a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/mbk-64"><em>Those Fascinating Numbers</em></a> by Jean-Marie De Koninck. I decided to take 
a glance through it to see what kinds of facts lie inside 
(and also to see <em>just</em> how many integers are covered!). Not only was I 
overwhelmed by the number of integers and the number of facts about them, 
the <em>preface</em> already includes one of the single wildest facts I’ve ever heard, 
and I have to talk about it here! Here’s a direct quote from the preface:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>37, the median value for the second prime factor of an integer; 
thus the probability that the second prime factor of an integer 
chosen at random is smaller than 37 is approximately $\frac{1}{2}$;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My jaw was on the floor when I read this, haha. First it sounded totally 
unbelievable, since 37 is a tiny number in the grand scheme of things. Then 
it started to sound slightly more plausible… After all, about half of all 
integers have $2$ as their smallest prime factor. It makes sense that smaller 
primes should be more frequent among the smallest factors of numbers! But then 
I thought “how can you possibly <em>prove</em> this!?”. I’m not much of an analytic 
number theorist<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but I know that they have good estimates on a lot of 
facts like this. I decided it would be fun to try and find and understand a 
proof of this fact, and also write some <a href="https://sagemath.org">sage</a> code to test it!</p>

<p>So then let’s go ahead and do it ^_^</p>

<hr />

<p>First, I think, the sage code. I want to know if this really works!</p>

<p>“Obvoiusly” there’s no uniform distribution on the natural numbers, so 
what does it even mean to choose a “random” one? The way the number theorists 
usually solve this problem is by fixing a large number $N$ and looking at 
the probabilities when you pick a random number between $1$ and $N$. Then you 
look at the $N \to \infty$ limit of these probabilities.</p>

<p>So for us, we’ll want to first fix a large number $N$ and then work with 
numbers $\leq N$. For $N$ kind of small, we can just find the second prime 
factor of each number $\leq N$ and <em>check</em> the median!</p>

<div class="auto">
<script type="text/x-sage">

def getSecondSmallestFactors(N):
    data = []
    for n in range(1, N):
        fs = factor(n)
        if len(fs) > 1:
            second_smallest = fs[1][0]
            data += [second_smallest]
        else:
            # If there's only one prime factor
            # say the second prime factor is infinity
            data += [oo]
    
    return data

@interact
def _(N=input_box(10^5, width=10, label="$N$")):
    data = getSecondSmallestFactors(N)

    med = numpy.median(data)
    show("median second prime: ")
    show(med)
    show("")

    below37 = len([d for d in data if d <= 37]) / N
    show("fraction of numbers whose second prime is at most 37: ")
    show(below37.n())
    show("")
</script>
</div>

<p>When I first ran this code, it honestly felt like magic, haha. What the 
<em>hell</em> is going on here!?</p>

<hr />

<p>The key idea, found in a paper of De Koninck and Tenenbaum<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, 
is that we can compute the density of numbers whose second prime is $p$ 
(which the authors denote $\lambda_2(p)$) by cleverly using the ideas in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a>!</p>

<p>Let’s do a simple example to start. What fraction of numbers have $5$ as 
their second prime? In the language of the paper, what is $\lambda_2(5)$?</p>

<p>Well it’s not hard to see that the numbers whose second prime is $5$ are 
those numbers whose prime factorization looks like</p>

\[2^a 3^0 5^b \cdots\]

<p>or</p>

\[2^0 3^a 5^b \cdots\]

<p>so we need to count the density of numbers of these forms.</p>

<p>But a number is of the first form ($2^a 3^0 5^b \cdots$) if and only if 
it has a factor of $2$, a factor of $5$, and <em>no</em> factors of $3$.</p>

<p>To bring this back to elementary school<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, we can highlight all of 
our numbers with a factor of $2$</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="/assets/images/37-median/number-grid-evens.png" width="50%" />
</p>

<p>numbers with no factors of $3$</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="/assets/images/37-median/number-grid-no-threes.png" width="50%" />
</p>

<p>and numbers with a factor of $5$</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="/assets/images/37-median/number-grid-fives.png" width="50%" />
</p>

<p>Then the numbers whose prime factorization starts $2^a 3^0 5^b \cdots$ are 
exactly the numbers highlighted by all three of these colors!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="/assets/images/37-median/number-grid-intersection.png" width="50%" />
</p>

<p>It’s intuitively clear that $\frac{1}{2}$ the numbers are blue, 
$\frac{2}{3}$ are orange, and $\frac{1}{5}$ are pink.
So taken together, 
$\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{15}$ of numbers 
are of this form!</p>

<p>So now we have our hands on the density of numbers of the form $2^a 3^0 5^b$,
but this is only one of two ways that $5$ can be the second smallest prime. 
A similar computation shows that 
$\left ( 1 - \frac{1}{2} \right ) \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{30}$ 
of numbers are of the form $2^0 3^a 5^b$.</p>

<p>It’s easy to see that these sets are disjoint, so their densities add, and 
$\frac{1}{15} + \frac{1}{30} = \frac{1}{10}$ numbers have $5$ as their 
second smallest factor!</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>Now with the warm-up out of the way, let’s see how we can compute 
$\lambda_2(p)$ for our favorite prime $p$!</p>

<p>We’ll play exactly the same game. How can $p$ be the second smallest prime?
Exactly if the prime factorization looks like</p>

\[p^b q^a \prod_{q \neq r \lt p} r^0\]

<p>for some $q \lt p$.</p>

<p>But we can count these densities as before! For each choice of $q$, we know 
that $\frac{1}{p}$ numbers are multiples of $p$, $\frac{1}{q}$ are 
multiples of $q$, and for each $r$ we know $\left (1 - \frac{1}{r} \right )$
numbers are <em>not</em> multiples of $r$! For each $q$, then, we want to land 
in the intersection of all of these sets, then we want to sum over our 
choices of $q$. Taken together, we see that</p>

<div class="boxed">
  <p>The density of numbers whose second prime is $p$ is</p>

\[\lambda_2(p) = 
\sum_{q \lt p} 
\frac{1}{p} 
\frac{1}{q} 
\prod_{q \neq r \lt p} \left ( 1 - \frac{1}{r} \right )\]

  <p>We can rearrange this to</p>

  <p>\(\displaystyle
\lambda_2(p) = 
\frac{1}{p}
\left [ \prod_{q \lt p} \left ( 1 - \frac{1}{q} \right ) \right ]
\sum_{q \lt p} \frac{1}{q} \left ( 1 - \frac{1}{q} \right )^{-1}\)</p>
</div>

<div class="boxed">
  <p>As a cute exercise, write $\lambda_k(p)$ for the density of numbers 
whose $k$th prime is $p$.</p>

  <p>De Koninck and Tenenbaum mention in passing that</p>

\[\displaystyle
\lambda_k(p) = 
\frac{1}{p} 
\left [ \prod_{k \lt p} \left ( 1 - \frac{1}{q} \right ) \right ]
s_{k-1}(p)\]

  <p>where
$s_j(p) = \sum \frac{1}{m}$
is a sum over all $m$ who have exactly $j$ prime factors, all of which are $\lt p$.</p>

  <p>Can you prove that this formula is correct<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>?</p>
</div>

<hr />

<p>But remember the goal of all this! We want to know the prime \(p^*\) so that 
half of all numbers have their second prime \(\leq p^*\). That is, so that 
the sum of densities</p>

\[\lambda_2(2) + \lambda_2(3) + \lambda_2(5) + \ldots + \lambda_2(p^*) 
\approx 
\frac{1}{2}.\]

<p>But we can implement $\lambda_2(-)$ and just <em>check</em> for which prime this 
happens!</p>

<div class="auto">
<script type="text/x-sage">
def lambda2(p):
    """
    Compute the density of the set of n whose 2nd prime is p.
    See equation (1.3) in Koninck and Tenenbaum, 2002
    """

    s = 0
    out = 1

    for q in Primes():
        if q >= p:
            break
        out *= (1 - (1/q))

    for q in Primes():
        if q >= p:
            break
        s += (1/q) * (1 - (1/q))^(-1)

    out *= s
    out *= 1/p 

    return out

total = 0
for p in Primes():
    if total > 0.5: break

    l = lambda2(p)
    total += l

    show("{} of numbers have {} as their second prime".format(l.n(),p))
    show("so {} of numbers have second prime at most {}".format(total.n(), p))
    show("")
</script>
</div>

<p>Again we see that $37$ is the prime where roughly half of all numbers 
have something $\leq 37$ as their first prime! So we’ve proven that 
$37$ is the median second prime!</p>

<p>Also, this shows that we expect the actual density to be $\approx .5002$. 
If we set $N = 10^7$ in the code from the first half<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>
to get a better approximation, we get $.5002501$, which is <em>remarkably</em> 
close to the truth!</p>

<div class="boxed">
  <p>As another cute exercise – using the ideas in this post, 
can you compute the median <em>third</em> prime?</p>

  <p>As a (much) harder exercise<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, can you get asymptotics for how 
the median $k$th prime grows as a function of $k$?</p>
</div>

<hr />

<p>Thanks for hanging out, all! This was a really fun post to write up, 
and I’m really excited to share it with everybody!
This fact about $37$ was all I could think about for like a week, haha.</p>

<p>I have more blog posts coming, of course, so I’ll see you all soon!</p>

<p>Stay safe, and stay warm ^_^</p>
